Dear World

Annika here, I would like you to know that I appreciate you very much because you are awesome. Also, I want to thank nature for Chickens. They are the best sort of animals because they produce eggs and I love eggs especially the egg yolk, it is delicious. Chickens are also very cute animals they are feathery and soft and are super fun to watch and be around with.
Because of my love for grown chickens, I am not a big fan of chicken meat. I prefer the embryo. 

My second favourite food thing is gingerroot, the flavour is fresh and spicy.
